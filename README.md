## Design 

### Design choice
When design th game I kpt the original game in mind. 
### Colour
When choosing the colour scheme, I kept the simial colour as th original game. As I wanted to the remind the user what it was like to play the original game on the Nokia Mobile take thm back in time. 
### Fonts
When desciding on the font I wantd something that wouldnt take over the page, something that would be rlaxing the maing th baord bing the main foucse on th page. So I went for Indie Flower its relaxing and flowing. 
### Structure
The strucrture of the websit is simple, easy to navigate the webpage. it only consits of two page the home page that has the game baord and the contact us page alowing th user to gt in contact:
- Home Page : The home page has the navigation bar on th top right and game title on th right.I fth user were to click on the game name it will take thm to th home page. 
- Contact Us page: The contact us page  has a form that alows the user to get in contact with the devloper of the game. once the form is fill and Send Messag is clicked then user is alreated that the form has been send.
