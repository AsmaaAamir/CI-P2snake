## Design 

### Design choice

I kept the orginal game in mind when creating the game because I wanted the users to experience some sense of familiarity and reminiscence with it. 

### Colour

I stuck with the same colour as the original game while creating the colour palette. I intended to transport the user back in time by reminding them of what it was like to play the original game on the Nokia Mobile.

### Fonts

When choosing the font, I was looking for something that wouldn't dominate the page and would allow the page's main focus to breathe. I choose Indie Flower because it is soothing and flowy.
### Structure
The website's structure is straightforward and simple to use. It just has two pagesâ€”the main page, which includes a gaming board, and the contact page, which enables users to get in touch:
- Home Page : On the upper right of the home page are the navigation buttons and the game title. A user will be directed to the main page if they click on the game's name.
- Contact Us page: The contact us page provides a form that enables users to contact the game's developer. After filling out the form and clicking Send Message, the user is informed that the form has been sent.

## Features

At the top of the page are the log and the navigation bar. When the logo, which is located on the left side of the page, is clicked, the user is returned to the homepage. The home page and the contact us page are linked in the navigation bar, which is on the right side of the page.

### Game Board
The middle of the page is occupied by the game board, which serves as the page's focal point. This is where the snake and the food are. The snake can be moved using the arrows on the keyboard or the arrows on the screen once the food has been consumed by the snake. The food then moves to its new place.

## Bugs 

*I received a warning while authenticating the Java Script, and I chatted with a tutor who advised me to disregard it. I've included this picture below.:
<details><summary>JS-warning</summary>
<img src="docs/bug-sg-1.png"></details>

* The snake can therefore be manipulated on an iPad and a phone. I had to write a function in an HTML page and create a onclick event, which left some variables empty.
